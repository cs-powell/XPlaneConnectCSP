##Quatitative Metrics of Performance
    --Descent/Localizer Overtime Graph 

Qualitative

##Cognitive
    -- Control equations, learned overtime; reinforcement learning
    -- Not continuous equations; discret steps (every 50 ms)
    -- "What if games" -> 
    --Injecting Distraction (something to take time outside of the control cycle)
        e.g. someone started daydreaming about missing their pet cat (40 milliseconds lost)
        By injecting the delays to represent different parameters -- 
        Explore different things about 
            Novice(other stuff, distracting stuff) vs. Expert(More frequent cycles)
                        Novice -- Uses checklist as a guide (Can't do anything without reading first)
                        Expert -- Uses checklist as verification of their flow/process
            Age (possibly)

Disturbances & Disturbance Tests (Demonstrate the limitations of the model)
    --Wind (& Wobbliness)
        Currently, lack of authority (and some missing control inputs) to stay back on track
    -- Wind, Gusting Wind, Turbulence(Rough Air), 

##Model
    -- What are ways in which it is realistic/Not realistic
        Approach vector maintenance laterally
    -- Disturbances
    -- Discussion Section of Paper, Future Directions Subsection
        


## Displaying Data
    --Plot, (associated Video as a supplement)
    -- Compute aggregate values (mean^2 error, etc, etc.)
    --Roll, Possibly use Same display as localizer but with top and bottom as Roll limits (i.e. 90 degrees)

##Action Items
1. Get model as is to land at the "ideal" point

2. Graph Production from the simulation
    1. Dump Raw Data during simulation (achieved) 
    2. Second peice of code, looks at raw data, produces the graphs/or the numbers that get pasted into excel
    3. Create fancy graphs (The punchline of the story) 
    --- Slide with graphs that can make consistent comparisons
    --- Novice, Expert, etc. -- What if games can be overlayed on top of that
